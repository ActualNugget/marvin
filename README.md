# Marvin
An AI bot that plays StarCraft 2

## Architecture
This version of Marvin is designed with a modular heirarchical structure. Higher-level modules are responsible for making abstract decisions about economy and strategy, while low-level modules set tactics for unit groups and individual unit micro.

## Acknowledgements
Marvin is powered by the excellent [rust-sc2] (https://github.com/UltraMachine/rust-sc2) library.
